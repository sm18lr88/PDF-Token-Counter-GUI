- Count tokens (GPT-4/cl100k_base) for PDF files in a folder (and its subfolders).
- A price estimate for my own personal reasons.

#### Why?
- I needed a tool to count tokens for lots of PDFs.
- Tool works smoothly, so I'm sharing.

#### Python Requirements: 
`PySimpleGUI` `fitz` `tiktoken`

- Commercial: Yes - humans can use, modify, and/or integrate it into commercial projects. No limits.
